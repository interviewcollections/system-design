## Home Timeline

Each write is fanned out 3 times for redundancy purpose.

We query the Social Graph Service to fan out the write to all the followers.

Every write is consist of:

1. tweet ID: the sent tweet
2. user ID: the sender's ID
3. bits: miscellaneous product related bits.

max limit: 800 tweets in your timeline

If you are not a active user \(logged in in the last 30 days\), we don't fan out write into your timeline.

Don't fanout write for users with large number of followers. Only do fan out for users with small number of followers.
